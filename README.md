This is a PWA designed to register and predict menstruation cycles. I made it for myself, so I only added the features I personally needed.

## Features

- Progressive web app (computer AND smartphone friendly)
- Google authentication
- Log menstrual start dates
- Predict when the next period should start
- Import/Export data

# Tech stack

This PWA is built using **React** as the front-end framework, is hosted on **Netlify**, and uses **Supabase** as the backend for database and authentication.

# Why I created this PWA?

Once upon a time... I used a simple website to log my menstrual cycles. I loved it because it was simple. And because it was a **website** that could be accessed using a **computer** (remember those good old times?). However, due to some American political shenanigans, the website was discontinued. Since all I could find were app-only services (yuck) and/or very complicated options (no, I don't need to log my mood or to know if I'm in the luteal phase), I ended up creating an Excel spreadsheet to log my cycles.

I promised I would create my own website as soon as possible to recreate my beloved simple period tracker. After postponing the project for a few years, I finally gave it a go and made this very simple, not-beautifully-coded PWA in just 3 days. It's not perfect, but it's better then a spreadsheet. I made it for myself, but maybe someone else out there will want to give it a try.

# Future

I don't plan on doing anything else with this because it's working and has what I need. Maybe, if I have time, I'll implement the service worker. Let's see.
